# ECE381-Final-Project
Whack-A-Mole Game on PSoC 4

This project involves programming a PSoC 4 microcontroller to play Whack-A-Mole on a custom 4x4 LED grid and keypad. We used a speaker to play different tones for each LED in the grid, each hit, miss, and game initialization as well as a 2x16 LCD for game- and high- scores.

The user can press any number button on the keypad to start the game. The start sequence plays on the speaker, and 'moles' start to appear for random durations with random brightnesses. If the user presses the corresponding button to 'whack' the mole, a tone plays to indicate the hit and the mole disappears. If the user presses the wrong button, a tone plays to indicate a miss. The current score is kept and displayed at the end of the game along with the high score.
